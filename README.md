# Spark_Flight_Regression


## Description
This notebook performs regression analysis on flight data using Apache Spark ML. It preprocesses flight data, applies feature engineering, trains a regression model, and evaluates its performance.


## Notebook Contents
1. **Importing Spark ML and creating a session** - Setting up the Spark environment.
2. **Loading flight data** - Reading the dataset.
3. **Preprocessing and feature engineering** - Handling missing values and transforming data.
4. **Training a regression model** -  Applying regression techniques to predict flight-related outcomes.
5. **Evaluating model performance** - Assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the regression model.


## Requirements
- **Apache Spark** 
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or a compatible environment


## Installation and Execution
